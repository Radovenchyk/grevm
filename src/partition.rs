/// execution. If a transaction fails, it is marked as a conflict; if it succeeds, it is marked as
/// unconfirmed. The final state of a transaction is determined by the scheduler's validation
/// process, which leverages the recorded read/write sets and execution results.
/// This validation process uses the STM (Software Transactional Memory) algorithm, a standard
/// conflict-checking method. Additionally, the read/write sets are used to update transaction
/// dependencies. For instance, if transaction A's write set intersects with transaction B's read
/// set, then B depends on A. These dependencies are then used to construct the next round of
/// transaction partitions. The global state of transactions is maintained in `SharedTxStates`.
/// Since the state of a transaction is not modified by multiple threads simultaneously,
/// `SharedTxStates` is thread-safe. Unsafe code is used to convert `SharedTxStates` to
/// a mutable reference, allowing modification of transaction states during execution.
